# Luau C API

Unofficial documentation of the [Luau](https://luau.org/) C API. Much of the Luau API is identical to the [Lua 5.1 API](https://www.lua.org/manual/5.1/manual.html). However, there are many additions, removals, and changes within Luau. Using the Lua 5.1 docs exclusively is not sufficient.

**API Reference**

The [Reference](reference.md) page contains documentation on the Luau C API.

**Guides**

The [Guides](guides/setup.md) page contains various how-to guides for extending Luau, such as creating efficient userdata types, using native code generation, sandboxing, and much more.
