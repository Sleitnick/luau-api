Gets the index representing the top of the stack. This also represents the number of items on the stack, since the stack index starts at 1. A stack size of 0 indicates an empty stack.

A common use of `lua_gettop()` is to get the number of arguments in a function call.

```cpp
int custom_fn(lua_State* L) {
	int n_args = lua_gettop(L);
	lua_pushfstring("there are %d arguments", n_args);
	return 1;
}
```
